#Robot Finds Ice Cream#

### An open source puzzle game###
 
In this game, you play as a young child at some unspecified date in the future,
far enough ahead of us that every child has a robot pet/friend/nanny, but not
quite so far in the future that humans have evolved beyond the need for
life-sustaining ice cream.  

In this game, you're going shopping with your robot, to purchase some delicious
ice cream.  Unfortunately, the robot is being a little difficult today;  owing
to a minor design flaw in its object-avoidance programming the robot absolutely
refuses to cross its own path, for fear of colliding with itself in the past.

Also unfortunately, the robot has the money.  And so as the child, you must
maneuver the robot to each of the vending machines in each level by either
pulling on the robot’s leash or by shoving the robot, but with the robot never
agreeing to cross its own path.

Also, you're inexplicably walking on floating platforms and can't move
diagonally.[^1]

[^1]: Because it's the future!


## The game ##

"Robot Finds Ice Cream" is a tile-based maneuverability puzzle game, where
you’re attempting to get your robot to each of the ice cream vending machines
on each level.  Apologies for the small number of levels, and the distinctly
programmer-created 'art',;  this was originally a "game in a week" project, and
all the levels were created during the last few hours of the week.


###History###
Robot Finds Ice Cream was originally released on July 27, 2008.  This version
has been updated to compile and run with the latest version of the VectorStorm
game engine.
